## **Learning Data Science and Algorithms with C++ - GloVersity**

Welcome to the Learning Data Science and Algorithms with C++ repository, organized by GloVersity (GloProg). This repository contains all the work, assignments, and code examples discussed during the Online Sessions aimed at helping students strengthen their understanding of data science concepts and algorithm design using C++.

## **Overview**

The Learning Data Science and Algorithms sessions focus on revisiting key C++ programming concepts, algorithms, and data science techniques. These sessions are designed to help both beginners and intermediate students improve their problem-solving skills and master real-world applications through practical exercises.

### **Instructors:**
- **Abdul Qadir Imran** - Lead Instructor, Certified Cloud Native Developer (CND)
- **Abdullah Iqbal** - Co-Instructor, Full-Stack Developer (FSD)

### **Learning Goals:**
- Strengthen foundational C++ programming concepts
- Master core algorithms and data structures
- Explore data science techniques like data manipulation, statistics, and machine learning algorithms
- Work with libraries like STL, NumPy, and others (where applicable in C++)
- Build real-world projects, including sorting algorithms, graph processing, and basic machine learning models

Each folder contains:
- Lecture notes
- Source code used during live sessions
- Assignments to practice and improve your skills

## **Syllabus Updates**
Here are the current topics for the syllabus, which will be updated regularly as the sessions progress:

- **Flowchart and Pseudocode**
- **Variables, Data Types, Operators**
- **Conditional Statements**
- **Loops**
- **Functions**
